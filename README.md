 Hey there, this is Mert and welcome to my internship case repo for Kartaca!
 
In this web app, you can bid to active auction items, and track status in real-time. In order to engage with the app, you need to create an account via using your email adress.

When the time of the item is up, no more bids can be placed and the winner is announced on the Auction Card.<br/><br/>
**Docker command**<br/> 
I learned basics of Docker with this project, and since backend side is live on firebase, i decided to include only frontend app to the docker.

To start this project with docker, simyple use:

``
  docker compose up -d
``


## UI Guide

Once you've logged in to your account, main page welcomes you with 3 Auction Card.
